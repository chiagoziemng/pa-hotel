Key Sections of the Landing Page

A typical hotel landing page might include:

    Hero Section: A full-width banner with a stunning image of the hotel, a catchy headline (e.g., "Welcome to [Hotel Name]"), and a call-to-action (CTA) like "Book Now."
    About Section: A brief description of the hotel, its vibe, and unique selling points (e.g., luxury, location, amenities).
    Rooms/Accommodations: A showcase of room types with images, descriptions, and a "Book" button.
    Amenities: Icons or cards highlighting features like a pool, spa, restaurant, or free Wi-Fi.
    Testimonials: Guest reviews to build trust (optional carousel or grid layout).
    Booking Form/Search Bar: A simple form to check availability (e.g., dates, number of guests).
    Footer: Contact info, social links, and navigation.

3. Design Goals

    Responsive: Mobile-first design using Tailwind’s responsive utilities.
    Modern & Clean: Leverage Shadcn/UI components and Tailwind’s flexibility for a polished look.
    Interactive: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and a functional booking form (mock functionality for now).
    Type-Safe: Use TypeScript for props, state, and API data (if we simulate a backend later).



Here’s how we’ll proceed when you’re ready:

    Setup: Initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript, install Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI.
    Layout: Create a root layout with a navbar and footer.
    Hero Section: Build a responsive hero with an image, text, and CTA button.
    Core Sections: Add rooms, amenities, and testimonials using Shadcn/UI components.
    Booking Form: Use Shadcn/UI’s form components for a mock booking feature.
    Styling: Apply Tailwind classes for responsiveness and polish.
    Testing: Ensure it works across devices and refine as needed.
